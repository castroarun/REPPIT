# Privacy Policy for REPPIT

**Last Updated:** December 20, 2024

## Introduction

REPPIT ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our REPPIT mobile application (the "App").

## Information Collection

### Data Stored Locally

REPPIT stores all user data locally on your device using browser localStorage. This includes:

- **Profile Information:** Name, age, height, and weight (optional fields)
- **Workout Data:** Exercise logs, weights, reps, and dates
- **Settings:** Timer preferences, unit preferences (kg/lbs), and app settings
- **Progress Data:** Calculated strength levels and achievement badges

### No Data Collection

**We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers.** All information you enter in REPPIT remains exclusively on your device.

### No Account Required

REPPIT does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or sign in with any service. You can use all features of the app without providing any identifying information.

## Data Storage

All data is stored using your device's local storage (localStorage). This means:

- Your data exists only on your device
- Uninstalling the app will delete all stored data
- Clearing your browser/app data will delete all stored data
- We cannot access, recover, or retrieve your data

## Third-Party Services

### No Third-Party Analytics

REPPIT does not use any third-party analytics services such as Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, or similar tracking tools.

### No Advertising

REPPIT does not display advertisements and does not share any data with advertising networks.

### No Social Media Integration

REPPIT does not integrate with social media platforms and does not share your data with social networks.

## Internet Usage

REPPIT requires an internet connection only for:

- Initial app loading (the app is a web-based application wrapped for mobile)
- No data is transmitted to external servers

## Permissions

REPPIT requests the following permissions:

- **INTERNET:** Required for the app to function as it loads from a web server
- **Screen Wake Lock (optional):** To keep your screen on during workouts when enabled in settings

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Your data is protected by your device's security measures
- We recommend using device-level security (PIN, fingerprint, face unlock)
- We cannot access your data as it never leaves your device

## Children's Privacy

REPPIT is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we collect no data, this is inherently maintained.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal data:

- There is no personal data to access, correct, or delete from our servers
- All your data can be deleted by uninstalling the app or clearing app data
- You maintain complete control over your data at all times

## Data Retention

We do not retain any user data as we do not collect any data. Data stored locally on your device remains there until you:

- Uninstall the app
- Clear the app's data/cache
- Clear your browser data
