## The Post (~1,300 chars)

```
Most people I know treat weight training as something "gym people" do. But science says that muscle is the single most critical organ for longevity. Bone density declines without load. Joints weaken without resistance. In a world of desk jobs and sedentary routines, push-pull-carry isn't a hobby — it's basic necessity.

𝗠𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝘀 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗱. 𝗥𝗘𝗣𝗣𝗜𝗧 𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱.

A 70kg bench press means something different for a 60kg person and a 100kg person. REPPIT knows the difference.

It's a strength profile tracker that rates every exercise against body-weight and gender-relative standards — auto-detecting your level from Beginner to Advanced.

Every strength standard, form cue, and coaching tip in REPPIT is backed by 2 intense years of hands-on training and science-based study.

80% of REPPIT was ideated, designed, and coded on the cloud with Claude Code — during MRT commutes on a mobile browser.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲:
• 77 exercises across 6 body parts with gender-specific strength multipliers
• 7 curated workout programs (PPL, Upper/Lower, Bro Split, Full Body + custom)
• Smart targets based on YOUR past workouts — uses pyramid progression and fatigue principles
• Auto-level detection — hit a PR, level upgrades automatically
• Muscle heatmap showing strong vs weak areas at a glance, so you know where to focus
• Rest timer with per-exercise memory
• Daily workout summaries with calorie estimates
• 8 achievement badges and 112 motivational quotes
• Coaching tips — form cues per exercise/level + contextual advice that spots imbalances in your profile and guides you on what to work on next

𝗡𝗼 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗱. Offline-first. All data stays on your phone.
Google sign-in available for cloud sync when online.

It wasn't all smooth sailing — Google Auth, Play Store approvals, and mobile tooling pushed back hard. The pain points are real and I've written about them in the article below.

𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁:
• Google Play Store — currently in closed testing
• Transformation photo tracker with ghost overlay for consistent before/after shots
• Multi-profile support — track family or gym partners

𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸: Next.js 16 • TypeScript • Tailwind CSS • Capacitor
